# Room Allocation — Java Programming Exam

**Authors:** Adam Finkelstein and Jérémie Lumbroso

## Topic

The exam asks students to allocate users into rooms, much like
the Zoom video conferencing software does when creating break-out
rooms. Several different heuristics are explored: Greedy,
round-robin and — for advanced students — random allocation.

The exam assesses mastery of core CS1 concepts: Functions
(calling, defining, modularity), loops, arrays, input/output.
